      <h2>5 Easy Ways to Teach your Toddler their ABCs and 123s</h2>
      <ol>
    <li>Count Out Loud and Often</li>      
         <p>We count the number of stairs we take, apples we buy at the shop, plants in our little garden patch. You can find ways to count everyday! Let your other half know what you are doing, they might like to join in and at the very least it gives him a heads up you haven’t gone crazy. </p> 
          
          <li>Read Books</li>
          <p>My youngest is a great fan of reading books, especially if Daddy is the one reading! Below are a few great books to get, most transition well into the preschool area so are worthwhile holding onto</p>
          
          <li> Sing Songs</li>
          <p>Tunes are catchy and fun!

Sing the “Alphabet” song with your toddler,  “Five Little Monkeys” and “One, Two Buckle My Shoe” for example.</p>
          
          <li> Print Worksheets / Coloring pages</li>
          <p>There are tons of websites available that have free number and letter worksheets. Personally I love to provide coloring pages!</p>
          
          <li>Toys & Learning Games</li>
          <p>Learning through play is the best way to teach!

Here are some games to play with your little one that incorporates ABC and 123.</p>

When a mom mentions she's looking for some great educational websites for her kids, it's not long before kidszone.com is mentioned.

          The site works with your children through letter recognition all the way through listening, playing.
          and works also in Shapes through coloring .
